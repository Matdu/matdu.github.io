#Oh, hi! 
Welcome to the repo of my site!

It uses an AMAZING free responsive Jekyll theme made by [PanosSakkos](https://github.com/PanosSakkos), with a few changes and also a few additions I've wanted to make it look cooler than it already is!

Feel free to use it, modify it, use parts of it that you like or even learn with it.

It has **MIT** license!
