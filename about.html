## About

I'm Matheus 'Matdu' Alves, I'm a passionate gamer, since I was 4, I loved technology, from learning it, to playing with it and discovering it, 2014 I got my first job working as a Front-End developer with some Back-End development aswell, since then I've grown love for Front End development while still learning Back End, of course!
